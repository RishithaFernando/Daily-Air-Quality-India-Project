# Daily Air Quality Analysis in India

## Project Overview
This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on daily air quality data across various Indian cities. The objective is to identify patterns, analyze pollutant relationships, handle data irregularities, and extract actionable insights regarding air pollution in India. The analysis is performed using Python (Jupyter Notebook), and Tableau visualizations will be added to enhance the storytelling aspect.

Project Status: Work In Progress  
- Python EDA Notebook: Uploaded  
- Tableau Visualizations: Coming Soon
